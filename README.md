# PFRL - Image Equalizer Logic Network
This repository contains the project code for the POLIMI course on Reti Logiche (Logic Networks) 
The project's objective was to construct a network of logic gates for the purpose of image equalization. 
The network was developed in VHDL and its performance was evaluated using benchmarks supplied by the professor.
